# Dialogue-Creator

Dialogue Creator is an application which allows to create logical chains of dialogues. All data is exported to JSON so that it's possible to plug them to any game. A [plugin for Godot](https://github.com/mifth/Dialogue-Creator/tree/main/addons/dialoguecreatorgame) is included but unfortunately there are no plugins for Unity and Unreal Engine. But that's not a big deal for Unity/UE developers.
